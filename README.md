MonoFrame Studio — Editorial One‑Page Portfolio



A minimalist, newspaper‑inspired single‑page portfolio layout for generative art and creative coding work. The design uses a strict grid, monochrome palette and editorial typography instead of gradients or heavy visuals.​

Features

Two‑column layout with fixed‑width sidebar navigation and main content column.​

Editorial “front page” hero with headline, subhead and snapshot panel.​

Compact “studies” section: four bordered project cards with grayscale hover images.​

Clean contact block oriented around commissions and collaborations.​

Fully responsive: sidebar collapses to top bar, single‑column layout on smaller screens.​

Tech stack
HTML5 for a semantic, single‑page structure (aside, main, section, article).​

CSS3 for responsive grid, flexbox layout, type scale and hover effects.​

No JavaScript dependency — everything is static and lightweight.​

Getting started
Clone or download the repository.​

Open index.html in a browser, or use VS Code with Live Server for auto‑reload.​
